  Deep Learning deciphered :A guide to understanding neural networks with
  Sherlock Holmesâ€™ investigative approach.                                   
  This is my first ever book published. It is my manuscript on deep learning
  which serves as a guide for adopting methods while writing code for AI models.
  This book takes readers on a journey through the intricate world of neural
  networks, guided by the timeless logic and keen observation of Sherlock
  Holmes. In this unique book, you'll explore deep learning concepts not just as
  theoretical knowledge but as puzzles to be solved and mysteries to be
  unraveled. Combining technical insights with practical advice, this book
  offers a unique approach for developers looking to master the art of
  artificial intelligence, making complex ideas accessible and compelling.
  Whether you're a seasoned professional or a curious newcomer, this book
  provides a fresh perspective on understanding and applying deep learning, all
  while indulging your inner detective.                                     Buy
