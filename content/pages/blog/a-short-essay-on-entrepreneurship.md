If you are someone who wants to start their own company and build new stuff, here is something you must remember:

The goal of business is to make some profit, by selling stuff to customers and providing positive value in the marketplace. The market forces determine the overall worth of your business, based on the universal law of power and supply. And you must never underestimate the power of building something, no matter how juvenile or simple it may be. The effort, and usefulness of the product for a few people, is what matters the most. Even if, let's say, you pick up  random rock and polish it, shine it, make it better, and put it for sale to someone at 10 cents, and if someone decides to buy it, what matters is that you created something valuable from nothing, and someone was willing to pay money for it, a transaction was completed successfully, and real money was now in your pocket! That is what matters the most. 

There's a character from the anime One Piece, who is kind of like a mentor to a character named Franky This character is a boatmaker who loves building ships, be it a travel ship, pirate ship, or a warship. When disaster strikes and people die because of a boat that Franky builds, Franky starts criticizing his invention. The mentor holds him in contempt and tells him a powerful lesson, which all people interested in entrepreneurship must remember, and I'm paraphrasing here : " It does not matter if what you build is a good thing or not, or if it positively or negatively affects other people. As an inventor, what matters is the act of invention itself, which must be free of any morality or human sins, and must involve only the joy one feels when one build something new and valuable. " He said this in the context of shipbuilding, but you get the idea.

There's a youtuber and fitness(or more accurately, a lifestyle and mindset) influencer, Togi, whose mentality applies well to a business owner. While he is a degenerate gambler and steroid glorifier, he has his moments of enlightenment when he shares some solid advice on how someone ahould approach society, and in general ,life. He says that, public opinion is worthless. Caring about what other people think about you is worthless. And these are words to live by. There are countless students who graduate as engineers and go to work for big corporations where all their ambitions and dreams are sucked right out of them ,turning them into mindless slaves stuck in a perpetual rat race, just becuase they care about what society thinks about them. This is an employee mindset. They lack the inner confidence to challenge other people. They forget that, behind every powerful corporation, legal entity, government,or country, there are people just like them who are making decisions that directly or indirectly affect their lives, forcing them to be controlled by the opinions and rules imposed by other people. What matters is that you must break out of this cycle ( essentially the matrix), take your life in your own hands, and build stuff for yourself. Why Zuckerberg? Why not you? You have everything in your power, to change your life, pursue things you love, and get paid for it eventually. 

 I have realized that pursuing something you love is what matters the most, but in a way that positively creates something valuable in the marketplace that others find valuable. It's no use following something you love if you cannot get paid for it, or if no one else finds it worthwhile, or if it's something obscure. No one will value you if you love coding in, say, assembly language, because the market does not put a strong value on such a skill. Hence, what matters is that, if you are someone who wants to build new stuff and get paid for it, find an intersection of something you love, and something that other people will readily pay you money for. That will drive your progress through the roof, via  powerful ways like equity, royalties, passive income, etc.
