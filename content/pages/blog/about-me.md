About me ( Things I like and do, How I started, and why )

Hi, I am Rohan Marar

My major topics of interest are: modern physics, technology(computers, electronics)

My hobbies are : reading books, bodybuilding, swimming

I have loved reading books of all kind, fiction or non-fiction, since I was in 5th grade. Started out with reading many fiction books, and my all-time favorites are Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot, as well as others such as The Ultimate Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, The Lord of the Rings, Game of thrones, harry potter, The Martian, and many more. I also love reading non-fiction books on world war 2 history, finance, entrepreneurship.

My all-time favorite is Sherlock Holmes. I love the way he demonstrates “the science of observation and deduction”, as well as other aspects of analytical reasoning, and I always enjoy murder mysteries.

When I was in 7th grade, I came across a video on my uncle’s laptop while I was searching for any games I could play. That 8 min video changed my life, it was a video of Brian Greene describing about Newton’s flawed concept of gravity and absolute physics, and how Einstein put forth the theory of General Relativity. That moment sparked my love for science , especially modern physics. Since then, I spent around 5 years exploring modern physics in great depth and technicality, reading many books on quantum mechanics and astrophysics, and enjoying the process of research. Because of this, I developed a strong way of imagination to visualize all the workings of space-time, quantum mechanics, etc; in my mind. My initial goal was to become a theoretical physicist, but that changed when my passion for inventing machines led me to pursue engineering.

Growing up, I was inspired by watching Iron Man and his cutting-edge futuristic tech, which also made me love technology, machines, and invention. Around the time I was in 11th grade, my passion for inventing machines and exploring tech transitioned into a way by which I could readily invent with freedom however I wanted: entrepreneurship. Elon Musk’s way of approaching business with a scientific mindset, and capitalizing on new tech breakthroughs that gives opportunities for inventions, resonated with me a lot. It is a definite goal of my life: to become an entrepreneur, a billionaire, and to create a company that invents cutting-edge futuristic tech, to bring sci-fi to reality. My habit of imagination and thought-experiments that I developed while I was studying modern physics, has resulted in me always daydreaming and imagining about futuristic stuff.

Since I was 18 years old, I developed another passion: bodybuilding. My father taught me bodybuilding, as it was his passion too, and slowly I began to love the gym a lot. The whole process of lifting heavy weights, pumping iron, and building more muscles, is my lifelong passion. I love the process, the dieting(being aware of what you eat + optimal protein intake), and growing bigger and better everyday, the mindset required to train intensely and constantly improve, and become master of your own body and mind, where I rely on the mentality of stoicism. This might sound odd, but I love to emulate the samurai mentality, that of someone who wants to constantly improve via discomfort and challenges, to achieve my future goals. “The Batman mentality”, so to speak.

When it comes to exploring a new topic, be it anything related to engineering or any technical stuff, I always prefer a method that involves tinkering, experimentation, and self-study, rather than conventional approaches to studying. I like to imagine new possibilities and come up with theories and ideas.

My favorite movies and TV shows are: Breaking bad, One Piece,Peaky Blinders, Sherlock, (Nolan, Scorcese ,and Tarantino movies).

Things that are a part of my future ambitions: technological singularity, R\&D, the ultimate equation to explain our universe.
