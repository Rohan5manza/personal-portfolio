I started this website as a way to document my life: things I have done, am currently doing, and plan to do in future. By no means is it possible to cover everything about me via a website, because there are many aspects of my life that cannot be documented, it is impossible. However, I can keep track of my progress, my plans for future, and get a clearer sense of direction and purpose by documenting and writing about things I do, and what goes through my mind from time to time. Hence this website serves as a way for me to document about myself, my personal goals and interests, and I keep writing in it regularly for my own purposes, to record stuff about myself, rather than as a means of displaying my portfolio or my progress to the public.

Also, there is the fact that I cannot document all things here online, because already I have many notes written in my notebooks, which consist of my ideas, theories, future plans, and important points I write down when learning something new or working on a new project. And sometimes it is easier for me to just sit down with a pen and write my thought processes, than typing on a keyboard.

Sometimes when I feel like writing on a technical topic, I may not use Substack, or any other blogging method, rather I will just write it here on my personal website.

Topics that I write here, may range from technical subjects, to fiction, to something purely personal to me, or my life experiences. I’ve noticed that instead of talking to someone, I prefer writing down my thoughts, and that gives me much more clarity. Hence I could’nt care less if no one reads my posts, because I’m doing this for my own purposes, and to maintain an online record .
