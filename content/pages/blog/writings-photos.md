I love writing. I love reading books. I love imagining stuff in my head, conducting thought experiments and daydreaming. I am an extremely ambitious person. As a futurist, I always like to imagine sci-fi scenarios, theories, possible inventions, and much more. 

Across a span of more than 5 years, from 7th std to the 3rd year of engineering college, I wrote a lot of stuff, all my ideas and things I wanted to write. I wrote them by pen in notebooks for future records. I wrote 3 books on business, invention and engineering, and sci-fi machines that could one day be possibly invented. I wrote 1 book on multiple fiction stories(half completed ideas, etc), ad screenwriting as a movie writer, writing ideas and diagloues and stories for new movies and tv shows. I wrote fiction like World war 3 story, world war 2 historical story, 1 Peaky blinder mafia type tv show, 1 crime mystery story, and 1 story on how the tv show Game of Thrones could have ended better, continuing from 7th season. I wrote 1 book on theoretical computer science, and 1 book on modern physics( and my own theories and imaginations). 

This is what probably marked my deep interest in writing as an author. I wrote all these for myself, but now I feel that I am comfortable building stuff in public as well, which also includes sharing my thoughts and writings to everyone.

I took photos of all my writings and have stored them in an album for digital saving, for personal record in future, in the eventuality that these books are misplaced or unfortunately destroyed. 

I do not expect anyone to understand my writings( as it is not legible , and my handwriting is bad, and all of what I have written can only be understood by me). In case you decide to go through my writings, know that I was a 15 year old boy when I wrote this, full of childish dreams and ideas flowing in my mind. It may look narcissistic, or childish to you, if you go through my photos, but I am happy for everything, and I sure as hell will always hold onto the sentiments I had when I wrote all this stuff.
